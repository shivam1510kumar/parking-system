        <h3>Tower Parking</h3>
        <p>Up to 70 m height; supports 2–2.5 ton vehicles.A Tower Parking System is a fully automated, vertical car-stacking solution designed for areas with limited horizontal space. Vehicles are driven into a ground-level bay, where a mechanical elevator lifts them into a multi-level tower, placing each car on individual pallets—sometimes rotating them for correct orientation at retrieval ([stolzer.com][1]). These towers can accommodate 50–100 cars within a footprint of just 3–5 traditional parking spaces, dramatically increasing capacity while minimizing land use . Tower systems offer fast retrieval (typically within 1–2 minutes), enhanced vehicle security, and environmental benefits—less idling, fewer emissions, and often integrated with solar or EV charging support ([qdmutrade.com][2]).

        <h3>Shuttle Parking</h3>
        <p>Above/below‑ground pallets with auto doors and lifts.A Shuttle Parking System is an advanced, fully automated solution that uses a combination of lifts and motorized shuttles to transport vehicles within a multi‑level parking structure. After drivers drop off their car at a ground-level transfer bay, a lift raises it to a designated level. There, one or more horizontal shuttles move the vehicle on a pallet into tightly packed spaces—often two cars deep—maximizing capacity in minimal footprint ([stolzer.com][1]). This system excels in high-demand environments like airports, malls, and commercial buildings, offering quick, secure retrieval, minimal emissions, and minimal walking for users ([stolzer.com][1]). It supports customization—indoor/outdoor, above or below ground, EV‑charging ready, and scalable with multiple lifts and shuttles for faster performance .

        <h3>Puzzle Parking</h3>
        <p>Efficient space‑saving designs for medium to large sites.A **Puzzle Parking System** is an automated, space-saving parking solution where vehicles are parked on movable platforms arranged in a grid. These platforms shift horizontally and vertically, creating pathways to store and retrieve cars efficiently—much like solving a sliding puzzle ([timesproperty.com][1]). They can double parking capacity compared to traditional lots, reducing land use by up to 50–60% ([expertparking.in][2]). With automated lifts and sliders, secure access controls, anti-fall sensors, and user-friendly kiosks or apps, puzzle systems offer fast, safe, and flexible parking tailored for both new buildings and retrofits ([utron.com][3]). They’re ideal for tight urban spaces while boosting efficiency and sustainability.

        <h3>Hydrolic Parking</h3>
        <p>Hydraulic parking systems use hydraulic lifts to stack vehicles vertically, doubling/tripling capacity in limited footprints. They offer automated, space-efficient parking with enhanced security, lower construction costs, and faster retrieval. Ideal for urban and residential settings, they're easy to install with proper power and safety measures.
